## References

Theme is inspired by [Base16 Ocean Dark Theme](https://github.com/carloe/spacegray-base16-ocean-dark) which was my long time favorite and based on [Oceanic Eighties Color Scheme](https://github.com/memco/Oceanic-tmTheme).

## Contributing

If you'd like to add some rules and styles to the theme please do it inside `.YAML-tmTheme` file. Then `.tmTheme` xml can be generated with such tool as [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) for Sublime.
